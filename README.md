# Random python util

A bunch of random python scripts I have written "decades" ago to help automate common day to day tasks.

## Barcode Appender - bc.py

Appends a dynamically created barcode to a pdf document given the user specified parameters. Used to aid barcode sorting machines.

## Merger - merge.py

A quick script to merge all the excel files within the current directory into a new file. Excel sheets must have similar column count.
